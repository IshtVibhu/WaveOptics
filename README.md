Optics simulations using the LightPipes optical toolbox are written in Jupyter notebooks. Students can open the notebook, read some introduction about the topic and perform exercises. The simulations are used as an introduction to real optical experiments in the lab.

The following notebooks are available:

1. [Newton_Rings_2019.ipynb](./Newton_Rings_2019.ipynb) **Newton rings** can be observed when light falls on a convex lens laying on a flat glass plate. By analysing the ring radii the radius of the convex surface of the lens can be determined.
2. [Fabry_Perot_2019.ipynb](./Fabry_Perot_2019.ipynb) The **Fabry Perot** interferometer is studied in this assignment. By changing the distance between the mirrors the difference between two wavelengths can be determined.
3. [Michelson_Interferometer_2019.ipynb](./Michelson_Interferometer_2019.ipynb) A **Michelson Interferometer** is simulated. The student studies the influence of the pathlength difference between the arms of the interferometer on the observed interference pattern.
4. [Fraunhofer_Diffraction_N_Slits_2019.ipynb](./Fraunhofer_Diffraction_N_Slits_2019.ipynb) **Fraunhofer diffraction** patterns are produced by illuminating a screen with one or more slits. The dependece of the far field diffraction pattern on the slit width, slit distances and the number of slits is investigated.
5. [Diffraction_Single_Slit_2019.ipynb](./Diffraction_Single_Slit_2019.ipynb) A **Diffraction pattern** is produced by illuminating a single slit with a monochromatic, plane wave. The student investigates the transition from Fraunhofer diffraction to Fresnel diffraction.


6. [spherical_wavefront.ipynb](./spherical_wavefront.ipynb) A **spherical wavefront** is produced by illuminating a small hole with a monochromatic, plane wave. The student investigates the inverse quadratic law by measuring, with the mouse, the intensity at the centre of the beam at several distances from the hole.
7. [ReflectRefract.ipynb](./ReflectRefract.ipynb) **Internal reflection and refraction** is studied. A linear polarized laser beam enters a glass and is internally reflected and refracted. The polarization and the angle of incidence can be varied.
8. [TwoHoles.ipynb](./TwoHoles.ipynb) **Young's experiment**. A plane monochromatic wave illuminates a screen with two small holes. The resulting interference pattern behind the screen can be studied.
9. [FresnelDiffraction.ipynb](./FresnelDiffraction.ipynb) **Fresnel diffraction** from a round hole is studied by measuring on-axis minimum- and maximum intensities as a function of the hole diameter and distance from the hole.
